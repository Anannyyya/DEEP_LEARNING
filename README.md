# Python Examples Repository

Welcome to the **Python Examples** repository! This repository contains various Jupyter notebooks and Python scripts demonstrating different machine learning and deep learning concepts. These examples were created using **Google Colab** for ease of execution and experimentation.

## üìÇ Repository Structure

### Jupyter Notebooks (`.ipynb`)

- **CV2.ipynb** - OpenCV examples for image processing tasks.
- **Deep_Learning.ipynb** - Deep learning concepts and implementations.
- **FNN.ipynb** - Feedforward Neural Network (FNN) implementation.
- **Image_using_MNIST.ipynb** - Working with the MNIST dataset for image classification.
- **Neural_Network.ipynb** - Implementation of basic neural networks.
- **RNN_pynb.ipynb** - Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) concepts and examples.
- **TorchVision.ipynb** - Using TorchVision for image processing and deep learning.
- **Untitled0.ipynb** - Miscellaneous or experimental code.

### Python Scripts (`.py`)

- **test.py** - Sample Python script for testing purposes.

## üöÄ Getting Started

### Prerequisites
To run these notebooks locally, you need to install the following dependencies:

```bash
pip install numpy pandas matplotlib seaborn torch torchvision tensorflow opencv-python
```

Alternatively, you can execute these notebooks in **Google Colab** without requiring local installations.

### Running the Notebooks
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Anannyyya/python_examples.git
   cd python_examples
   ```
2. Open a Jupyter Notebook or Google Colab.
3. Load any `.ipynb` file and run the cells.

## üìå Key Topics Covered
- **Computer Vision (OpenCV, TorchVision)**
- **Deep Learning (Neural Networks, FNN, RNN, MNIST)**
- **Machine Learning Fundamentals**
- **Python for AI & ML**

## üí° Contributing
